`eventmodeling-hcl` v0.4.0 implements Event Modeling HCL Specification v0.3.0.
This repository provides a strict validator, canonical formatter, typed semantic model,
normative language documentation, and executable examples. The domain reference is the upstream [Event Modeling
Specification](https://github.com/dilgerma/event-modeling-spec); the HCL
specification and validator in this repository define its native port. The
format is not a JSON embedding or conversion format.

The language is designed for hand authoring: bounded contexts own canonical
events, reusable field types, and aggregates; workflow kind is the top-level
block keyword; typed HCL traversals express canonical relationships; and
derivable bookkeeping is not written. Native scenarios and workshop blocks
preserve the rules and durable artifacts of an Event Modeling session.

## Requirements and Installation

Install Go 1.25 or newer and build the validator from this checkout:

```bash
go build -o bin/eventmodeling-hcl ./cmd/eventmodeling-hcl
```

Published release archives for Linux, macOS, and Windows are available from
the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/event-modeling-hcl/eventmodeling-hcl/releases).
Verify a downloaded release archive with that release's `checksums.txt` before
use:

```bash
sha256sum -c checksums.txt
# macOS: shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt
```

Stable release archives and `checksums.txt` also have GitHub build provenance.
With GitHub CLI 2.49.0 or newer, verify the downloaded archive was produced by
this repository's release workflow:

```bash
gh attestation verify eventmodeling-hcl_0.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
  --repo event-modeling-hcl/eventmodeling-hcl
```

Validate one complete model per invocation:

```bash
./bin/eventmodeling-hcl validate examples/minimal.em.hcl
./bin/eventmodeling-hcl validate examples/complete.em.hcl
./bin/eventmodeling-hcl validate examples/pet-management-detailed.em.hcl
./bin/eventmodeling-hcl validate --profile strict examples/complete.em.hcl
./bin/eventmodeling-hcl fmt -w examples/complete.em.hcl
```

A valid document prints `<path> valid`. Diagnostics use the form
`file:line:column: Severity EMxxx: message`. The default `valid` profile keeps
modeling judgment as warnings; `workshop` reports it as information and `strict`
escalates unreasoned commands and open hotspots to errors.

Model files must use the `.em.hcl` extension. HCL is the language; the suffix
identifies a complete Event Modeling document to this validator. Check the
installed binary version with `eventmodeling-hcl version`.

Render a valid model as a self-contained, interactive HTML canvas with
content-adaptive slices, left-to-right flow stages, dedicated screen,
processor, model, and event swimlanes, typed flow arrows, and scenarios
available from each slice:

```bash
./bin/eventmodeling-hcl diagram examples/complete.em.hcl -o complete.html
./bin/eventmodeling-hcl diagram examples/complete.em.hcl > complete.html
```

The `diagram` command validates with the default `valid` profile before
rendering. Errors prevent output; modeling warnings are reported without
blocking the diagram. The generated file embeds its CSS, JavaScript, and model
data. Domain events use Event Storming orange; events owned by external bounded
contexts use pink. Events in the same slice are arranged horizontally. Each
actor card renders directly beside its associated screen card, and flow arrows
that point backward in the left-to-right layout (their target sits left of
their source) use a dashed stroke, turning solid only while hovered. A
`screen_image` retains its user-supplied URL, so that preview may load external
media when the HTML is opened.

For a local edit-and-render loop, serve one model and keep the browser open
while the file changes:

```bash
eventmodeling-hcl serve examples/minimal.em.hcl
```

`serve` binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Use `--port 0` to request an
available port; the actual browser URL is printed after binding.

## Authoring

Top-level `bounded_context` blocks define domain contracts. Top-level
`state_change`, `state_view`, `automation`, and `translation` blocks define the
four workflow patterns. Labels carry identity and use lower snake_case. Events
are declared only inside bounded contexts and participate in workflows through
typed flow or scenario references.

```hcl
bounded_context "pet_management" {
  title = "Pet Management"

  aggregate "pet" {}

  field_type "pet_id" {
    type         = "Int"
    id_attribute = true
  }

  event "pet_added" {
    title     = "Pet Added"
    aggregate = aggregate.pet

    field "pet_id" { type = field_type.pet_id }
  }
}

actor "clinic_staff" {
  title         = "Clinic staff"
  auth_required = true
}

state_change "add_pet" {
  title = "Add Pet"

  screen "add_pet_form" {
    title = "Add pet form"
    actor = actor.clinic_staff
    to    = [command.add_pet]
  }

  command "add_pet" {
    title     = "Add Pet"
    aggregate = aggregate.pet_management.pet
    to        = [event.pet_management.pet_added]

    field "pet_id" { type = field_type.pet_management.pet_id }
  }
}
```

A `field` whose name matches a `field_type` may drop the `type`
(`field "pet_id" {}`), and `fields = [field_type.pet_management.pet_id]` adds
several typed fields at once. Screens and other workflow elements carry fields
the same way events do.

Source position is model order. A flow edge has one canonical spelling: the
source element uses `to`, except catalog events flow through the receiver's
`from`. References are unquoted traversals and are checked for scope, kind, and
existence. Ordinary values are native HCL literals; variables, functions, and
interpolation are rejected.

Read models state the question they answer, and scenarios use typed targets:

```hcl
state_view "pet_directory" {
  readmodel "pets" {
    question = "Which pets are registered?"
    from     = [event.pet_management.pet_added]
  }

  scenario "pets_are_listed" {
    given { event = event.pet_management.pet_added }
    then  { readmodel = readmodel.pets }
  }
}
```

Use native values for field examples:

```hcl
field "pets" {
  type        = "Custom"
  cardinality = "List"
  example = [{
    id   = 5
    name = "Mochi"
  }]
}
```

## Verification

Run the complete local verification suite before submitting a change:

```bash
make verify
```

`make help` lists individual commands. The most commonly used are `make build`,
`make test`, and `make validate-examples`.

The test suite validates every `.em.hcl` file in `examples/` and asserts every
fixture in `testdata/invalid/` fails validation.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), then install the repository hook
after cloning:

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

The hook checks common repository hygiene, formats changed Go files, checks
module consistency when `go.mod` or `go.sum` changes, and runs `go vet ./...`
and `go test ./...`. Run the same hooks against the whole checkout with:

```bash
make pre-commit-run
```

`make verify` remains the full local quality gate; it also runs race, static,
exhaustiveness, vulnerability, example-validation, and release checks.

## Boundaries

The supported HCL Specification v0.3.0 resolves references within a single
document and enforces scoped identity, canonical typed flows, scenario shape,
field examples, and workflow patterns. `internal/app` exposes the shared
application operations, and `internal/model.Build` constructs a typed IR only
from a validator-issued `ValidatedDocument`. The tool does not support event
groups, context maps, multi-file loading, cross-file reference resolution,
JSON conversion, or editor integration.
