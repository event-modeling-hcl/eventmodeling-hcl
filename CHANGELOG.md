# Changelog

This repository records implementation releases of the validator, formatter,
and typed IR. The authoritative Event Modeling HCL language history is in the
[specification changelog](https://github.com/event-modeling-hcl/spec/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-09-10

This release adds interactive ways to author and preview models, improves the
diagram's domain layout, and reorganizes the implementation around explicit
application and validation boundaries. The Event Modeling HCL language is
unchanged — it still implements Specification v0.3.0.

### Added

- `serve <model.em.hcl> [--addr H] [--port N] [--profile P]` command: a local
  edit-and-render loop that watches one model and live-reloads the rendered
  diagram in the browser. It binds `127.0.0.1:8080` by default; `--port 0`
  requests an available port and the actual URL is printed after binding.
- In-browser playground: the real parse, validate, format, and render core
  compiled to WebAssembly (`cmd/wasm`), driven by a dependency-free editor under
  `web/playground/`. Everything runs client-side — nothing typed leaves the
  browser.
- Playground integration hooks for a host-supplied editor and initial source,
  plus `eventmodeling:status`, `eventmodeling:diagnostics`, and
  `eventmodeling:rendered` events.
- `cmd/playground-seed` (with `internal/playground`) generates the playground's
  seed model from `examples/minimal.em.hcl`.
- `build-wasm` and `wasm-check` Makefile targets; `wasm-check` runs as part of
  `make verify`.
- `architecture-guide.md` documents the repository's Axiomatic Design
  requirements, influence matrix, module contracts, and change rules.

### Changed

- Rendered diagrams now group domain events into one lane per aggregate under a
  bounded-context header, replacing the single flat Events swimlane. The
  Screens, Processors, and Model rows are unchanged, and all wiring, filtering,
  drawer, and theme behavior is preserved.
- CLI, WebAssembly, and live-server use cases now share `internal/app`; source
  interpretation is centralized in `internal/source`, grammar lives in
  `internal/syntax`, and canonical model construction requires a
  validator-issued typed document.
- The Go toolchain is pinned to patched Go 1.26.6 for release and verification
  builds.


## [v0.4.0] - 2026-09-07

This release implements Event Modeling HCL Specification v0.3.0: a `field` block
may omit a redundant `type`, and a `fields` list declares several typed fields
at once.

### Added

- Field shorthand: a `field` block may omit `type` and infer the same-named
  `field_type` — resolved in the owning `bounded_context` for event and subfield
  fields, and by unique document-wide name for workflow-element fields.
- `fields = [field_type.<...>]` list attribute on events, workflow elements,
  tables, and scenario steps, synthesizing one field per entry.
- Screen `field` blocks and `fields` lists are now exercised by the shipped
  examples and covered by tests.

### Changed

- A `field_type` declaration must still set an explicit built-in `type`; only
  plain `field` blocks may use the shorthand.
- The formatter ranks the `fields` attribute with the semantic group, before
  `from` and `to`.
- The rendered HTML diagram reports Event Modeling HCL Specification v0.3.0.

## [v0.3.1] - 2026-09-07

This release polishes the diagram canvas introduced in v0.3.0.

### Changed

- Actor cards render directly beside their associated screen card instead of
  in a dedicated actor swimlane.
- Backward-pointing flow arrows (whose target sits left of their source in
  the left-to-right layout) render with a dashed stroke, reverting to solid
  only while hovered.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-09-06

This release adds rendering tooling while retaining full compatibility with the
v0.2.0 Event Modeling HCL language specification.

### Added

- `diagram <model.em.hcl> [-o <file>]` command for generating a self-contained,
  interactive HTML Event Model canvas from the validated typed IR.
- Workflow-level `screen_image` previews, canonical flow arrows, slice filters,
  scenario details, field metadata, chapters, and hotspots in rendered diagrams.
- Content-adaptive left-to-right slice layouts with dedicated actor and processor
  swimlanes, horizontally grouped events, and actor-to-screen highlighting.
- Event Storming pink styling for events owned by external bounded contexts,
  while domain events retain their orange styling.

### Changed

- The typed IR retains field-type ID/PII metadata and scenario examples needed
  by downstream renderers.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-09-05

Implements the v0.2.0 native HCL language surface. See the
[specification changelog](https://github.com/event-modeling-hcl/spec/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
for the normative language history.

### Added

- `fmt` command that canonicalizes whitespace and attribute order idempotently
  while preserving semantic block and scenario order.
- Validation profiles `--profile workshop|valid|strict`, with `valid` as the
  default and `strict` escalating unreasoned commands and open hotspots to errors.
- Stable `EMxxx` diagnostic codes, reported as
  `file:line:column: Severity EMxxx: message`.
- Typed IR via `internal/model.Load`: a validation-gated model with effective
  titles, normalized source-to-target edges, and semantic/presentation separation.
- Invalid fixtures for reverse-flow and State-View `when` scenarios.

### Changed

- Moves the public Go module to
  `github.com/event-modeling-hcl/eventmodeling-hcl`.
- Enforces one canonical flow spelling per edge; reverse forms now fail validation.
- State View scenarios take one or more event `given` steps and `then` read-model
  steps, with no `when`.
- Titles are optional and derived from labels when absent.

### Removed

- The `query` scenario target and reverse flow spellings.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-09-02

- Initial native HCL validator release.
